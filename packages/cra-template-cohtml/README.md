# cra-template-cohtml

This is the official base template for [Coherent Labs' Gameface](https://coherent-labs.com/products/coherent-gameface/).
It provides the foundation required for create-react-app to work with live reload in Gameface.

To create a react application with this template run:

`create-react-app my-test-app --scripts-version react-scripts-cohtml --template cra-template-cohtml`

After that navigate to `my-test app` and do `npm run start`. This will start a development server with live reload enabled.
